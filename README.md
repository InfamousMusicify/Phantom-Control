# Phantom Control  
#### Minecraft: Java Edition - Data Pack   

### More control over pesky Phantoms!  

    Purpose:  
    Give players more control over how phantoms effect them.  
    Make phantoms friendly or kill them, near players with the setting enabled.  
    Phantoms will behave as normal by default, players can choose to make them freindly.    
    Admins can choose to kill ''Friendly Phantoms'' with kill.phantoms, 
    players can save them by turning off freindly phantoms and using /trigger save-phantom.   

-
     Commands:  
`/trigger phantoms` - toggle friendly phantoms - if kill.phantoms is enabled by an admin, phantoms within 15 blocks of this player will die.   
`/trigger save-phantom` - mark nearest phantom to be saved from kill.phantoms - will also show nearby saved phantoms with particles    
`/trigger save-phantom set 2` - Show saved phantoms with Particles, wont mark to save phantoms.   

     Op Commands:  
`/function phancon:config` - Configure phantom control    
-
    Compatibility:  
Will not work (or will break the other pack) with any other datapacks that utilize adding a player to a team. or packs that add phantoms to a team.  

`(Mojang... Teams are kind of scuffed... why cant an entity join multiple teams...  i get it but... this is limiting haha.)`
